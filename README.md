# Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction of heart disease can significantly aid in providing timely treatment and saving lives. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health parameters.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a publicly available heart disease dataset, which contains several health-related attributes. The dataset is imported using the following command:

python
Copy code
data = pd.read_csv('heart.csv')
# Libraries Used
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables. The preprocessing steps are crucial to prepare the data for model training and evaluation.

# Modeling
Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated in this project, including but not limited to:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
# Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

# How to Run
Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
